# Introduce

This is a boilerplate for creating React.js project quickly. It is pretty similar to [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate). I made this from scratch just for practice.

This boilerplate includes these components

* Gulp, as a building system
* React
* React-router
* Babel
* less, for css
* Mocha and Chai, for unit-test

# Usage

To install dependency
```bash
$ npm i
```

To start development
```bash
$ npm start
```

To run unit test

```bash
$ npm run test
$ npm run test:watch    # watch test files change
```

To build project. Built files should be placed under **_public** directory.

```bash
$ npm build
```
